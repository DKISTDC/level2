It is widely accepted that they are key to understand the dynamic and energetic balance of the lower solar atmosphere. A reliable quantitative measurement of the physical parameters in spicules is extremely challenging due to the scales of their dynamism which are very often close to the resolution limit of modern solar telescopes. Furthermore, modeling and interpretation of chromospheric spectral lines, in which spicules are emitting, are always challenging as it requires solving the complex non-LTE (i.e., departures from Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) radiative transfer problem. We plan to study solar spicules using high-resolution full Stokes spectropolarimetric data in the Ca II 8542 Å line that can be obtained with the ViSP instrument on the DKIST. Spectropolarimetric inversions using a new version of the non-LTE code NICOLE will be used to construct semiempirical models of the spicules. The models will be used to obtain height stratification of the temperature, mass density, magnetic field, velocity and optical thickness along the spicule. High-resolution imaging data with the VBI instrument will be used to identify spicule and determine mass flows (plane of sky velocities) along the structure. "

Some investigations have shed light on essential aspects of them, but there are still open questions concerning their magnetic field vector. Besides, penumbral microjets pop up above photospheric regions where magnetic reconnections may occur due to the sheared configuration of the magnetic field. However, clear evidence of this process is still missing. We aim to study the 3D topology of the magnetic field vector of lateral downflows. This analysis is important to model the magnetic field configuration of sunspots penumbrae and to investigate the relation between penumbral microjets and the presence of lateral downflows.

These dynamic phenomena are challenging, yet critically important, targets that require multi-wavelength, high-speed, and high-resolution observations for complete characterization.  That said, several open questions regarding this chromosphere-corona interface can be addressed using very deep observations that are within reach of the DKIST Cycle 1 capabilities using the Cryo-NIRSP He I 1083 nm channel, despite its lower spatial resolution in comparison to the AO-assisted instruments.  Moreover, advancing high dynamic range Cryo-NIRSP observations will benefit a range of science use cases to come.  We propose Cryo-NIRSP polarimetric observations, using both the spectrograph and context imager, of the solar limb that include scanned time-series observations, as well as very deep observations, so to take advantage of the unique low-scattered light and high dynamic range provided by DKIST.  Our objectives include addressing whether: (1) there is a He I line width signature of a temperature increase coinciding with the rapid fading of type II spicules, (2) spicule magnetic field strengths are ubiquitously larger than earlier observations suggest, (3) missing mass in the rain drainage exists at low emissivity, and (4) magnetic fields can be obtained from coronal rain off-limb (if observed).  A secondary goal (if permissible) is to explore the spicule connection with the low corona in the forbidden 1079.8 nm coronal line, which in principle fits on the detector simultaneous with He I, and could provide vital temperature diagnostics."

Although the exact mechanisms that transport and dissipate that energy in the chromosphere are not yet known, many theoretical models have been proposed. \n\nOur goal is to study how the presence and dissipation of electrical currents in the lower boundary of the magnetic canopy contributes to the heating of plage chromospheres.

However, the identification of such waves in the lower solar atmosphere is a complex problem because the various eigenmodes available in the MHD Hilbert space have overlapping properties. This has limited studies to low order modes. One aspect of MHD wave modes that has only been identified in observations very recently, is the spatial characteristics of the mode across the flux tube [1]. This is a key component in understanding energy transfer from the waveguide to the quiescent environment and therefore represents a crucial step in the contribution of the various wave modes to heating the solar atmosphere. As such, this proposal is commensurate with the DKIST science objectives with respect to wave generation and heating in the atmosphere. By availing of the high-resolution observations and spectropolarimetry made possible with DKIST, our proposal aims to gain new insights into the surface and body characteristics of wave modes in the smallest of magnetic structures (i.e, magnetic bright points) at multiple heights in the solar atmosphere. This will allow us to ascertain the importance of magnetic bright points in energy transfer within the quiet Sun as well as the mechanisms involved."

Our recent detections of chromospheric intensity oscillations varying temporally and spatially before, during and after flares suggests a promising new line of investigation into flare energy deposition in the solar chromosphere, which we propose to develop with these DKIST observations. Oscillations or pulsations with periods around 3-minutes probe the mechanical, thermal and magnetic properties of the solar chromosphere, all of which can be strongly disrupted by the intense deposition of energy and momentum during a flare’s impulsive phase. With a combination of high-cadence VBI observations through narrowband filters (on which we will also test our new machine-learning techniques for atmospheric seeing corrections) and spectropolarimetric observations in the Ca II 8542 Å and Fe I 6302 Å lines we will investigate the oscillatory response of the chromosphere to a flare."

We propose to observe the restructuring of the magnetic field in 3D by using photospheric and chromospheric polarimetry with ViSP observations of the 6301/6302 Å and 8542 Å lines. We will derive temporal sequences of the evolution of the vector magnetic field in both layers. Fast photospheric and chromospheric context imaging will allow us to study the small-scale structure of the propagating flare ribbon.

The launch of NASA’s IRIS satellite, has also provided new observations in UV diagnostics that are not observable from the ground. However, one limitation of space borne missions is the relatively large spatial resolution-gap in comparison with ground-based facilities. Resolving very small spatial scales is now considered a key observational requirement in order to resolve the scales at which energy deposition takes place during flares.\n\nIn this project we propose to combine the excellent diagnostic potential of the Ca II H, Ca II 8542 and Fe I 6302 lines, observed with unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution in order to observationally constrain the atmospheric changes that very rapidly take place during the first stages of the flare.

We aim to infer the time-dependent topology of the magnetic field, as well as the flow field.

Kotani & Shibata (2020) performed 3D MHD simulation of magnetic reconnection with solar photospheric parameters and showed that jet-like structures were induced by reconnection in the solar photosphere. We also pointed out that MHD waves generated by photospheric anemone jet-like structures could influence the local chromospheric heating and the formation of spicules. However, our numerical simulations did not reveal the statistical nature of the photospheric anemone jet-like structure, as the simulations were performed given typical and expected parameters. We propose to detect the anemone jet-like structures with their length of approximately 100 km in the photosphere for the first time and to investigate their statistical properties and their effects on chromospheric heating and spicule formation through the high-resolution DKIST observations of photosphere and chromosphere."

Making 2D maps of wave power and phase velocity at each frequency, we can investigate the relationship among the frequency of waves, the dynamic behaviors of the prominence, and the spatial distribution of wave power.

We have recently found associated with these horizontal vortex tubes significant signal in linear polarisation, located at the trailing dark edge of the granular lane. We concluded, with the assistance of 3-D MHD simulations, that the vortical flows of granular lanes are capable of transporting magnetic flux to the solar surface within granules—a process termed as “shallow recirculation” by Rempel [2018ApJ...859..161R]. Supposedly, this mechanism is an important component of the small-scale dynamo acting at the solar surface and generating the quiet Sun magnetic field. We propose to undertake the first systematic study of granular lanes and their fine structure with high-cadence photospheric G-band images at unprecedented spatial resolution.

In particular, chromospheric swirls, which occur co-spatially with the relative motion of photospheric magnetic bright points (BPs) were suggested to be an efficient mechanism for channeling energy from the photosphere to the corona. Using CO5BOLD magnetohydrodynamics simulations, we investigated the origin and evolution of these magnetic swirls. Toroidal velocity and magnetic field components of opposite sense of rotation have been found to occur during these events. Furthermore, we found that they propagate as unidirectional swirls with the local, time-dependent Alfvén plus bulk speed, in the upward direction. The two findings are in perfect agreement with the corresponding properties of torsional Alfvén waves. We found that they originate from the perturbation of the magnetic field at their footpoints, which, in turn, enhances the magnetic tension, causing the rotation on the magnetic field and hence the rotation of the plasma. \nThe logic consequence is to validate these simulation results by means of observations. To do that we need image sequences with a spatial resolution similar to that of the simulations and we need polarimetry of high sensitivity.

Main objectives of this investigation will address (among others) and focus on the spatio-temporal characteristics of penumbral flows as detected in different lines of the CO band and their relationship to the magnetic field, and the umbral structure within the layers where the CO lines form. We will apply standard spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric techniques (including inversion techniques) to analyze this rich data set. As existing observations in the CO fundamental band are limited in resolution and rare (specifically sunspot observations) to begin with, we expect that the significant leap in spatial and temporal resolution of these first observations will allow for a lot of discoveries to be made."

PJs were proposed to form from component (acute angle) reconnection of the magnetic field in spines with that in interspines and were proposed to contribute to transition-region and coronal heating above sunspots. In a recent investigation, it is proposed that penumbral jets form as a result of reconnection between the opposite polarity field at edges of filaments with spine field, and it is found that most of these jets do not significantly directly heat the corona above sunspots, but could indirectly drive coronal heating via generation of MHD waves or braiding of the magnetic field. However, there exist larger jets, repeatedly forming at tails of penumbral filaments, which directly display their signature in coronal wavelengths. Some of the larger penumbral jets are also found to show twisting motion. By using DKIST unprecedented resolution data we propose to investigate the formation mechanism of penumbral jets, and twisting in them. "

It has been suggested that prominence plasma is supported against gravity by the Lorentz force, and neutral atoms are supported by the frictional force between them and the ions. Relative flow causing the frictional force corresponds to a diffusion of the magnetic field from the neutral atoms, which is called ambipolar (Pederson) diffusion. Khomenko et al. (2016) detected the relative flow velocity in a prominence, as shown by the difference in Doppler velocities of spectral lines in the range of ±1 km s^−1. On the other hand, Anan et al. (2017) claimed the difference of Doppler velocities as being a result of the motions of different components in the prominence along the line of sight, rather than ambipolar diffusion. In order to interpret the relative flow velocity, we request observing time to obtain Stokes profiles of solar prominences off the solar limb in H Ⅰ 397 nm, Ca Ⅱ H and Ca Ⅱ 854 nm, with the Visible Spectro-Polarimeter (ViSP). The H Ⅰ line is near the Ca Ⅱ H line and within the same spectral window of the ViSP.

Such a photospheric rotation gradient has not been directly seen in Fraunhofer Doppler measurements. Furthermore the decreasing rotation rate at all latitudes in the outer 5% of the Sun, inferred from p-mode oscillations, is not explained by global solar convection models (ref. 3) and, in any case, does not account for the presumed photospheric rotation gradient evident from sunspot tracers and plasma Doppler data.

In principle, the rate of transport of magnetic energy, the Poynting flux, can be estimated as a cross-product of vector magnetic and electric fields. Limited studies quantified Poynting flux in active regions using the PDFI method and HMI/SDO data (Kazachenko et al. 2014). The PDFI method relies on Faraday's law and spectropolarimetric inversions of high-cadence vector magnetic fields to estimate the electric fields. The properties of the energy fluxes in the quiet Sun (QS) have not yet been characterized due to the paucity of high signal-to-noise observations with high spatial and temporal resolutions. To that end, we propose to use ViSP to invert QS magnetograms that will allow us to obtain Poynting fluxes in the photosphere using PDFI. ViSP presents an opportunity for drastic improvements: previous Hinode vector magnetic field observations have insufficiently high cadence to allow us to use the PDFI method, whereas IMaX QS maps do not have the spatial resolution we hope to achieve with ViSP. To complement ViSP magnetograms, we propose to use VBI intensity maps in the photosphere and the chromosphere to 1) correlate energy fluxes with optical features, and 2) derive optical flows using FLCT and DeepVelU methods and compare these with physics-based PDFI quantities.

Recently a breakthrough has been achieved through the discovery of nanojets in the solar corona. This phenomenon corresponds to fast, bursty, very short lived, small-scale jet-like structure with an estimated energy within the nanoflare range. It was demonstrated that nanojets go hand-in-hand with nanoflares in the reconnection scenario and constitute the tell-tale signature to look for reconnection-based coronal heating in action. However, the bulk distribution of the nanojets could not be resolved and only hints of an MHD avalanche were detected.

A growing amount of observational evidence suggests that this phenomenon is ubiquitous, recursive and even highly periodic in the solar corona, and particularly in active regions. Such reports suggest that a large but yet uncertain number of coronal structures are in a state of thermal non-equilibrium and are therefore bound to specific spatiotemporal properties of the heating.

Like for previous PSP encounters and transits, a world-wide coordination of multiple observing facilities is being planned, with a campaign currently envisioned for the June 1-7, 2022 period. The current proposal requests Director’s Discretionary Time (DDT) to conduct DKIST on-disk observations in passive coordination with PSP during a portion of this period. The scientific aim of these observations is that of investigating the magnetic environment of the “footpoints” of PSP during its passage on the solar disk. We propose to use both the ViSP and VBI to assess the dynamic and magnetic environment of the solar structures that give rise to the solar wind material experienced by PSP (“sub-solar-wind point”). In particular, we advocate for large raster maps with ViSP in polarimetric mode, using the CaII 854.2 nm line to investigate the chromospheric magnetic topology. Observations with DKIST should be conducted on June 2nd  and 3rd (if possible). "

(2021) recently demonstrated with data from numerous total solar eclipses that prominences are invariably surrounded by a coronal cavity containing plasma at high electron temperatures (~2 MK), often form the base of helmet streamers, and commonly erupt into the solar wind. Despite the importance these structures have in the corona and solar wind, they are relatively poorly understood. The main obstacle for learning more about these structures has been a lack of comprehensive data throughout a prominence cavity. The existing observations are either too low in resolution, or observe emission that is too tenuous in the outer cavity (in the case of EUV observations) to perform the requisite analysis to learn more about these structures. Only the high spatial, spectral and polarimetric capabilities of Cryo-NIRSP at present are able to probe the density, magnetic field, temperature, and flows throughout a prominence cavity. Thus, we will take a collection of spectro-polarimetric data in a scan through a prominence cavity on the solar limb with the Fe XIII line pair as well as the He I line.

Wave-driven coronal heating models are supported by observations that Alfvén waves are found throughout the corona and that they appear to be damped so that their energy may go into heating. However, there are still many unresolved problems. One issue that it is not definitely clear whether or not the low corona is turbulent.  A second is that previous measurements suggesting wave damping in the quiet Sun have large uncertainties due to limited spectral resolution of the instruments used. Also, the origins of any sunward-propagating waves are not well known. They may originate from excitation at opposite footpoints on closed loops, reflection in the corona, or parametric decay instability (PDI). Our proposed measurements will address these problems. We will look for evidence that Alfvén wave energy loss is associated with turbulence; determine how Alfvén wave and density fluctuation amplitudes change with height; evaluate the relative energy in outward versus sunward traveling waves; and test whether Alfvén waves undergo PDI in the quiet Sun corona. For this we will use Cryo-NIRSP spectra focusing on the Fe XIII 1074.7 nm line.

The rate of transport of magnetic energy, the Poynting flux, can be expressed as a cross-product of vector magnetic and electric fields. Limited studies quantified Poynting flux in active regions using the PDFI method and HMI/SDO data (Kazachenko et al. 2014). The PDFI method relies on Faraday's law and spectropolarimetric inversions of high-cadence vector magnetic fields to estimate the electric fields. The properties of the energy fluxes in the quiet Sun (QS) have not yet been characterized due to the paucity of high signal-to-noise observations with high spatial and temporal resolutions. To that end, we propose to use ViSP and DL-NIRSP to invert QS magnetograms that will allow us to obtain Poynting fluxes in the photosphere using PDFI. ViSP and DL-NIRSP present an opportunity for drastic improvements: previous Hinode vector magnetic field observations have insufficiently high cadence to allow us to use the PDFI method, whereas IMaX QS maps do not have the spatial resolution we hope to achieve with DKIST instruments. To complement the magnetograms, we propose to use VBI intensity maps in the photosphere and the chromosphere to 1) correlate energy fluxes with optical features, and 2) derive optical flows using FLCT and DeepVelU methods and compare these with physics-based PDFI quantities. We also plan to investigate how Poynting flux varies with height. This study will improve our understanding of energy transport in the QS in quantitative terms."

Thanks to the advances in instrumentation and inversion techniques, observers have recently reported even stronger magnetic fields outside the umbra, at the endpoints of coalescing penumbral filaments close to the outer boundary of a sunspot. At these locations, strong magnetic field concentrations (SMFs) with strengths larger than 7 kG were found. SMFs are accompanied by supersonic downflows reaching speeds of 20 km/s and more. The presence of such strong fields is still highly controversial: They were only detected in the deepest layers of the solar atmosphere by using a newly developed technique to infer the magnetic field strengths from observations by Hinode. The spatial resolution of those observations was barely sufficient to resolve the fine structure within these 1 Mm-sized features. The high spatial resolution of DKIST and the possibility to perform multi-line observations to access a larger height range in the solar photosphere offer a unique opportunity to unambiguously confirm the existence of SMFs, and study their properties.

Confirmation of this hypothesis, however, is not a simple task; nor is the question of limited impact.

Regions with delta-sunspots are responsible for producing the majority of strong flares.  The polarity inversion line in these sunspots are the sites of unusual, long-lasting behavior: stretched penumbral filaments with strong upflows and downflows, magnetic fields parallel to the solar surface exceeding the umbral magnetic field in strength, and complicated spectral line profiles that hint at multiple components.  The aim of this proposal is to obtain DKIST observations of a delta-sunspot polarity inversion line using multi-height diagnostics of the plasma velocity and magnetic field at high spatial resolution.  DKIST is the only facility capable of carrying out simultaneous observations of plasma diagnostics that span from the deep photosphere (Fe I 1565 nm), through the temperature minimum (Na I D 589.6 nm) and chromosphere (H-beta 486.1 nm, Ca II 854.2 nm), to the transition region (He I 1083.0 nm).  These observations will be used to determine the topology of the magnetic field, how the flows along the polarity inversion line are connected through the atmosphere, and if the complex line profiles are due to structure that was previously unresolved by other instruments or if it is due to multiple structures along the same line of sight."

A turbulent cascade is expected to create significant power in the flow fields smaller than 100 km and to interact with magnetic fields. The unpreceded spatial resolution achieved with DKIST allows us to examine velocity and magnetic fields at hat spatial scales for the first time. It is also possible that there are significant contributions of unresolved flows, such as micro-turbulence and LOS velocity gradients, even with the DKIST resolution. The most powerful approach to diagnosing micro-turbulence and the LOS velocity gradient is to use spectral line profiles, especially line broadening and asymmetry, which contain information on the flow fields that happened in a fading phase of granules (Ishikawa et al. 2020). The line broadening in a fading granule is thought to be caused by turbulent motions generated in the lower photosphere. Thus, the primary objective of the proposed observation is to investigate the temporal evolution of turbulent motions and magnetic fields. To achieve this, we will obtain the spectro-polarimetric profiles of the Fe I 1565 nm, Si I 1082.7, and C II 854 nm lines with DL-NIRSP together with the spectroscopic profiles of Fe I 630 nm lines with a high temporal cadence to capture the temporal evolution of the micro-turbulence, LOS velocity gradient, and magnetic fields in the photosphere and the chromosphere."

Such extrapolations are much more reliable if the input magnetic field is measured at a height in the atmosphere where the fields are primarily force-free. Otherwise, ad hoc corrections must be applied to account for plasma forces on the field. Therefore, it of significant importance to know at what heights the force-free approximation can be reliably applied.\\nPrevious efforts to address this question have been carried out by Metcalf et al.

Only Metcalf et al. used magnetic field measurements in the upper photosphere (using Na I 5896 \\u00c5) in order to characterize the magnetic field with height through the bulk of the photosphere.\\nWe plan to observe multiple lines simultaneously and apply modern inversion techniques to more robustly measure the components of the vector magnetic field over a wider range of heights than has previously been determined. Analysis by Zhang et al (2017) suggests that this can only be achieved with the high signal-to-noise provided by the DKIST aperture. We will then use our results to determine the heights at which the force-free approximation is valid.

One potential such tracer is the ubiquitous population of switchbacks detected in situ during the Parker Solar Probe encounters. The number of these large-scale changes in magnetic polarity shows no apparent dependence on distance from the solar photosphere, arguing for a formation mechanism near the solar surface. Therefore, we propose DKIST observations that probe one of the leading theories for switchback formation near the solar surface, namely interchange reconnection in coronal holes. Specifically, the proposed observations will provide much needed constraints on the magnetic field topology, and especially the degree of mixed polarity, in predominantly unipolar coronal holes. This will allow us to track the magnetic field structure as it evolves in time and how it varies over photospheric and coronal heights with unprecedented detail. In turn, this allows us to place limits on the rate of interchange reconnection, and thereby determine if such reconnection events provide a plausible seed for the observed population of switchbacks."

Such events are still not fully understood simply because we have never been able to probe them with enough spatial or spectral resolution. Our aim here is to better understand the complex physics occurring within sunspot chromospheres through the investigation of the localised dynamics of the umbra on the smallest possible scales. Firstly, we will investigate how important SDFs/SSUBs are in the global dynamics of sunspots through statistical analysis of their properties (spatial extents, frequencies, lifetimes) using incredibly high-spatial resolution imaging data sampled by the VBI. Secondly, we will extract physical parameters of the sunspot atmosphere from the 630.2 nm, 854.2 nm, and 1083 nm spectra sampled by ViSP and DL-NIRSP co-spatial to SDFs/SSUBs, using numerical inversion codes such as NICOLE. This will help us to understand the formation mechanisms of these events. The polarimetric data collected by DKIST will allow us to infer the velocity and temperature stratification within SDFs/SSUBs with exquisite detail meaning it will be possible to determine whether MHD waves are steepening into shocks at heights sampled by these lines.

It consists of both small-scale umbral microjets and dark thin fibrils that are revealed during umbral flashes. First observed by Socas-Navarro (2009), precise semi-empirical modelling of these features is instrumentally limited. Both microjets, other brightenings and fibrils are visible that are not synchronous with umbral flashes (Bharti et al. 2013, Nelson et al. 2017). The accuracy of inversion schemes in the highly dynamic umbra when using wavelength scanning instruments (Felipe et al., 2018) is limited. Still, insight using inversion schemes is possible and has revealed that phase differences in the flow fields, secondary to acoustic wave steepening, plays a role in the joint formation of both bright and dark structures (Henriques et al. 2020). However, what quantity exactly causes the dark components to be visible at all is an open problem and the literature disagrees on the nature of the small-scale brightenings and on the atmospheric models behind umbral flashes themselves. Multi-line spectra at DKIST allow for a resolution of the exiting degeneracies at sufficiently fast acquisition times that overcome the limitations identified by Felipe et al.

These magnetic patches seem to be related to the slow disaggregation of the magnetic flux tubes that were previously stuck together in sunspots. MMFs can be of different types, depending on the sign of magnetic polarity closer to the parent sunspots. Their interpretation is related to different configurations of the magnetic field (whether resembling a U-loop, an \\u03a9-loop or a serpentine-like shape). The MMFs observed so far have generally a size of few arcsec, but it is possible that higher spatial resolution observations will reveal the presence of smaller structures and this finding would be important to verify whether they have a hierarchical subdivision and how they contribute to the erosion/disappearance of sunspots. The spectropolarimetric capabilities of DKIST instruments would allow us to detect the very first phase of detaching of MMFs from the penumbra or even from the umbra and verify whether both occur following a similar process. The capabilities of the VISP and DL-NIRSP will be fundamental in order to characterize the magnetic properties of the MMFs at different atmospheric levels and reveal the role that patches characterized by different magnetic polarities have in the umbra erosion.

Upon interaction with magnetic fields, the acoustic oscillations get converted into the slow and the fast magnetohydrodynamic modes, of which the slow mode waves continue to propagate along the magnetic field. It has been shown that the umbral flashes, running penumbral waves, and the propagating coronal disturbances observed in the sunspots are different manifestations of this propagation. The high thermal conduction and other dissipative processes in the solar corona, are known to cause rapid decay and eventual disappearance of slow waves. However, recent studies reveal a significant damping in these oscillations in the lower atmospheric layers. It is likely that this damping in the lower atmosphere is due to a combination of dissipative (e.g., radiative losses, shock dissipation) and non-dissipative processes (e.g., reflection, mode conversion). In order to assess their true dissipation and develop a comprehensive understanding on their propagation across the solar atmosphere, we need full spectral information at multiple heights along their propagation path.

To accommodate this complication, and ambiguities intrinsic to the linear polarization, we would adopt two approaches: we would (1) apply the coronal tomographic techniques of Kramar and co-workers to full-Stokes Cryo-NIRSP data and produce 3D coronal magnetic synoptic maps; and (2) forward-model the Stokes parameters using the FORWARD coronal magnetometry toolset applied to MHD simulation data to provide unprecedented observational magnetic constraints on the MHD modeling."

        "experimentDescription": "Plage regions are bright chromospheric patches that coincide with concentrations of strong, predominantly unipolar magnetic fields in the photosphere. Several physical mechanisms have been suggested to play a role in the plage heating, but their contribution to the energy budget of the chromosphere has not been quantified and thus remains poorly understood. This is partly due to the lack of spatial resolution and polarimetric accuracy in previous observations to adequately investigate the interplay between plage fields and energy deposition in the chromosphere. We aim to improve the magnetic field measurements in plages and study the heating rates' dependence on the field strength and topology. This will be achieved using configuration 3a, providing multiple spectral diagnostics suitable for data inversions. Comparisons between observations and spectral synthesis from state-of-the-art radiative-magnetohydrodynamics simulations will provide further insight into the plage atmosphere. We request observations of the same (or different) plage region(s) at two different positions: (1) offset from the disk center but not too close to the limb, and (2) at or close to the disk center. Furthermore, we will run two experiments each day: a large context scan and a high-cadence program in a smaller field of view (FOV). The large FOV can be used to investigate the stratification of the magnetic field and how it relates to the spatial inhomogeneities of the heating rates. The high-cadence experiment will study dynamic phenomena such as waves and reconnection to track down the mechanisms behind the enhanced heating rates in plage regions. "

Yet, the nature and extent of this emission remains incompletely characterized. We propose to leverage the unique capabilities of DKIST and the Cryo-NIRSP to study the circumsolar distribution of the He I 1083 nm triplet line together with the density sensitive Fe XIII 1075, 1079 nm lines.  Previous measurements of He I have determined the line to be quite faint (<1 x 10-6 Idisc), yet present at elongations between 1 - 1.5 Rsun.  Thanks to the larger, unobscured, off-axis design of DKIST, and the significantly reduced scattered light it provides, DKIST is uniquely positioned to map out the faint triplet HeI 1083 nm emission in order to better understand the origin of this signal, and to develop it further as an essential tool that supports multi-messenger and lower coronal science. The goal of this proposal is to study the distribution of the He I 1083 nm emission and its correlation with coronal structure through well calibrated spectropolarimetric observations of the HeI 1083 nm line, closely followed by FeXIII 1075, 1079 observations of the same region to provide an estimate of the electron densities. We plan to compare these observations against predictions from two hypotheses of the emission source: desorption from an inner dust source or as an equilibrium population in the million degree corona."

There are have been many proposed theoretical explanations for the origin of the heating, but none have satisfactory observational constraints. One of the most prominent candidates for chromospheric heating is the dissipation of high-frequency waves driven from the convective overshoot at the base of the photosphere. Recent work has provided evidence in both directions, as authors disagree if high-frequency waves could provide the required energy flux to sustain the quiescent chromosphere. We propose observational program with DKIST that could provide better observational limits to the high-frequency flux carried in the chromosphere. Furthermore, the polarimetric capabilities of DKIST could provide us with the first observational estimate of the role of the magnetic field in the propagation and dissipation of waves in the lower solar atmosphere."

Such study allows us to understand whether the submergence or emergence of magnetic field lines takes place at the magnetic flux cancellation sites. We also study how the surrounding convective motions affect the difference between the flux cancellations caused by the submergence and emergence of magnetic field lines from the comparison with the flow patterns derived from the G-band images with VBI. The flux removal process at the flux cancellation site is not yet spatially resolved even by the recent state-of-the-art instruments.

Bright-point shape changes will be treated with new methods to study thin-tube wave modes unaccessible with pre-DKIST observations. The magnitudes, morphology (curls, divergences, coherence lengths), and lifetimes of photospheric flows, on the smallest observable scales, have major implications for our understanding of atmospheric heating, magnetic evolution, and fundamental properties of convection. We will address three primary questions. First, what is the approximate energy budget attributable to a variety of thin-tube wave modes? Second, what are the lifetimes of small-scale flow patterns? Rapidly changing photospheric flows can drive turbulence in the overlying magnetic field as recently launched, upward-propagating Alfvénic waves interfere with reflected, downward-propagating waves. Dissipation of such turbulence could lead to atmospheric heating. Third, are small-scale vortical motions present, and if so what are their properties?  Such flows were long ago hypothesized to play a key role in coronal heating and have been seen in more recent radiative-MHD simulations of near-photosphere convection. We will address these science themes with a relatively simple observation program, and we will also address several additional questions."

Recently, identification of individual source locations and the mapping of the propagating wavefronts associated with them has become possible using deep learning powered filters. While these techniques have been developed and tested on synthetic observations from numerical simulations, with the advent of the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope, ground based observations can achieve the resolution and temporal cadence needed for their application to real solar-image time-series. Extending previous investigations on the wave propagation and the leakage of solar p-modes into the chromosphere, we propose: mapping the photospheric sources of individual wave excitation events, following the waves emitted from those sources with height, and study  height dependent interaction between wave field and the ambient magnetic field. The effort will offer well resolved, high cadence multi-height observations of the magnetic-acoustic interaction."

Despite the importance these structures have in the corona and solar wind, they are relatively poorly understood. The main obstacle to learning more about these structures has been a lack of comprehensive data throughout a prominence cavity. The existing observations are either too low in resolution or observe emission that is too tenuous in the outer cavity (in the case of EUV observations) to perform the requisite analysis to learn more about these structures. Only the high spatial and spectroscopic capabilities of Cryo-NIRSP at present are able to probe the density, electron and ion temperatures, and flows throughout a prominence cavity. Thus, we will take a collection of spectroscopic data in a scan through a prominence cavity on the solar limb with the Fe XIII line pair as well as the Si X and He I line.

Spectral line shapes can provide robust diagnostics of coronal heating as they contain information about both fluid motions of the emitting plasma and the ion velocity distribution produced by the heating process. Moreover, they are robust measurements in the sense that they implicitly average over small spatial and fast temporal scales. Recent measurements of line shapes have suggested that non-thermal line broadening decreases with height, suggesting Alfven wave damping; that ion temperatures are larger than electron temperatures in a way that depends on charge-to-mass ratio, implying that there is a resonant ion heating process, and that the line shapes are non-Gaussian, which may be due to turbulence in the fluid or a signature of the heating process. Existing measurements have been limited by systematic uncertainties, particularly the spectral resolution of the instruments. DKIST Cryo-NIRSP offers an order of magnitude improvement in spectral resolution that will significantly reduce these uncertainties. Moreover, the recent upgrade of Cryo-NIRSP to measure ions of different masses (silicon and iron) will allow us to infer the contributions from fluid motions, which are the same for both ions, versus the ion velocity distribution, which can differ between ion species.

One of the most prominent candidates for chromospheric heating is the dissipation of high-frequency waves driven from the convective overshoot at the base of the photosphere. Recent work has provided evidence in both directions, as authors disagree if high-frequency waves could provide the required energy flux to sustain the quiescent chromosphere. We propose observational program with DKIST that could provide better observational limits to the high-frequency flux carried in the chromosphere by observing two regions -- one close to disc center and one close to the limb. Furthermore, the polarimetric capabilities of DKIST could provide us with the first observational estimate of the role of the magnetic field in the propagation and dissipation of waves in the lower solar atmosphere. A parallel project based on the observational data obtained from this project would be to study the signatures of the Hanle and magneto-optical effects on the observed polarization in the Ca II K line close to the limb.

Studying coronal loop oscillations is one way to distinguish between the strand-like or veil-like structure of the corona. The goal of the proposed observation is to focus on the detailed characteristics of the oscillations in the active region coronal loops, taking advantage of coronographic capabilities of DKIST. The observation will provide spectral information in coronal lines, while keeping sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to detect coronal oscillations and their properties including the variation and evolution of velocities across the oscillating loop, the evolution of non-thermal broadening at the loop boundaries, and the magnetic field and density diagnostics. This will enable us to compare the signatures associated with oscillation evolution and damping to the signatures predicted by the idealised thin tube models and to the signatures of coronal oscillations in non-ideal waveguides present in the convection-zone-to-corona simulations. It will also enable us to test commonly used coronal seismology methods. As a result, the observation will help to constrain the coronal loop models and clarify whether coronal loops are better represented by compact isolated strands or diffuse, turbulent structures."

The turbulent Alfvén wave-driven in-situ formation scenario aligns with various observational constraints, while interchange reconnection provides a compelling explanation for the observed ionization degree and elemental abundance in the solar wind. Indicators of interchange reconnection include presence of strong current sheets at the interface between open and closed magnetic fields, enhanced temperatures, and confined upward plasma flows. These processes facilitate energy transport across magnetic fields, driving the solar wind in the low solar corona.

A new technique – CICCI – allows for the robust detection of current systems in the solar atmosphere by separating magnetograms into “components” based on where the source current lies in relation to the height of the magnetic field measurement. We propose DKIST observations of one or more active region PILs in three spectral lines (Fe I 630.2 nm, Na I D1 589.6 nm, and Ca II 854.2 nm) which span the photosphere and chromosphere. These lines will be used to infer the active region magnetic field as a function of optical depth, which will be decomposed by CICCI to infer the current structures which lie between each pair of magnetograms.

Hence, high-frequency Alfvenic waves are critical for efficient energy dissipation. Moreover, multiple Alfvenic modes are expected to exist in the corona, with only the kink mode having been identified routinely in the corona The high temporal and spatial resolution of Cryo-NIRSP offers an unprecedented opportunity to discover whether multiple Alfvenic modes and high-frequency Alfvenic waves are present in the corona.

At the solar photosphere, sunspots are the largest and strongest concentrations of the magnetic field embedded in a turbulent medium comprising convective plasma motions. While convection is strongly suppressed in the central dark core of the sunspot umbra, which harbours a magnetic field strength more than 2 kG, the observed brightness is insufficient to be attributed to radiative losses alone. Hence convection, reduced significantly, is necessary to explain the brightness in the umbra. This transport of energy by convection, is responsible for the small, bright structures called umbral dots, that populate the dark umbral background as seen in high resolution images. Umbral dots and their fine structure are thus fundamental to the determination of the thermal budget and in turn, the stability of sunspots. This is essential for constructing a realistic and consistent sunspot model which unifies all the different small-scale features in sunspots, namely, penumbral grains, penumbral filaments, and light bridges. We propose a study of sunspot fine-structures using high resolution spectropolarimetric observations from the DKIST telescope.

Another important physical quantity is turbulence, on which many coronal heating mechanisms rely. Turbulence is often assumed to hide in the non-thermal line widths. Line-of-sight superposition due to the optically thin hot coronal emission greatly impedes accurate determination of these essential physical quantities.

To quantify this heating we need to understand the shocks we are observing, however, the behaviour of shocks observed in sunspots is far from understood.

Observations will be coordinated with multiple instruments on Solar orbiter (EUI/FSI,  EUI/HRI, SPICE, and Metis), as well as IRIS and Hinode, in order to provide a comprehensive assessment of the Dark Halos physical properties, and ascertain their origin. Observations will be acquired near disk center on March 12, 2025.  \n\nGiven that Dark Halos are very extended, we'll first obtain a mosaic of 4 different telescope pointings, covering an area of ~ 220\" x 140\", using ViSP in the intensity-only mode. We'll then raster an area of about 110\" x 70\" in polarimetry mode, sampling both chromospheric and photospheric lines. VBI chromospheric and photospheric imaging will be obtained as well."

        "experimentDescription": "We propose to use high-cadence ViSP spectroscopy in the Ca II H, H-Alpha, and Na I D1 regions to investigate the relative broadening of hydrogen and calcium in bright solar flare kernels and the timing of flare evolution throughout the photosphere and chromosphere. We will determine whether broadening in the narrow Ca II H and broad hydrogen Balmer lines occur at different locations and times within the flaring area. These high resolution spectra will provide much-needed constraints on the current modeling approach for stellar flares. We will compare model spectra calculated from a new semi-empirical flare modeling code to determine the electron charge density and optical depth in chromospheric condensations. Then, the ViSP spectra will be used to test the detailed time evolution of the pressure broadening of hydrogen predicted in RADYN+RH simulations of high-flux electron beam heating.  We will explore the extent to which flare activity extends into the photosphere with the Na I D1 line, and search for white-light flare kernels in the blue continuum images from VBI."

        "experimentDescription": "Despite the progress made in recent decades in understanding the physics of solar flares, the fundamental and longstanding question of how the solar atmosphere responds to the flare energy release remains unanswered. It is well known that the most dynamic characteristics of the flaring atmosphere are intense upflows (hot, explosive evaporation) and downflows (cool condensation), which redistribute mass and energy from the photosphere to the corona. Due to the high complexity of the flare phenomenon, including its multi-thermal nature and multi-component flows, advanced, high-resolution, multi-instrument observations are essential to investigate the thermodynamic properties of the flare atmosphere. Through this proposal, we aim to perform spatially and temporally combined observations of solar flares with ESA’s Space-based Solar Orbiter (SO) mission and DKIST. In March 2025, SO has plans for coordinated observations dedicated to the Major Flare SO Observing Plan (SOOP) program. The DKIST proposal requests Service Observing Time (SOT) to conduct on-disk observations in coordination with SO during this period. Such an approach offers the unique opportunity to measure the plasma flows at different heights and times, enabling the direct investigation of the velocity field of the atmosphere and its evolution during the flare."

        "experimentDescription": "Simulations from the MURaM photosphere and observations from DKIST OCP Cycle I have revealed numerous local wave fields propagating in the photosphere and low chromosphere. While recent observations have confirmed the existence of these waves, the impact of localized magnetic fields and the broader ambient magnetic environment on their generation and propagation remains unclear. In this observation proposal, we aim to investigate the magnetic influence on the generation, propagation, and statistical characteristics of these waves. We propose fast measurements of the deep photosphere and low chromosphere in (1) a quiet sun region (with minimal magnetic activity), (2) an active network, and (3) a plage region. Using DKIST/VBI's Red Continuum and Ca II K channels, we request the fastest possible (~3 s) cadence and high-resolution (<0.02 arcsec/pixel) observations, which are critical for studying wave emission, scattering, and absorption at very small scales in varying magnetic environments."

This approach is based on a collection of broad science objectives that address key aspects of the DKIST and CryoNIRSP science mission.   The goal is to motivate a set of regular or on-demand observations that could be called upon for multiple purposes and multiple opportunities; albeit the observation strategy may need to be slightly adjusted for the particulars of the opportunity. This approach complements the PI-led observations and is meant to provide additional data to the community at large to help advance the DKIST science mission within the corona. "

        "experimentDescription": "Alfvénic waves are thought to be a key mechanism for energy transfer in the Sun’s atmosphere, providing the energy to meet the radiative losses of the dense chromosphere and hotter, tenuous corona, along with the demands required to accelerate the solar wind. In recent years there has been clear evidence for the presence of low-frequency (f<10 mHz) Alfvénic waves through the chromosphere and corona, and they are ever-present throughout the solar cycle. The low-frequency waves are difficult to dissipate without an additional process that can move the wave energy to small-scales (e.g., phase mixing, resonant absorption, MHD Turbulence) where large gradients can develop to enhance diffusive and resistive processes. Hence, high-frequency Alfvénic waves are critical for efficient energy dissipation. MHD turbulence is leading candidate to explain the heating and acceleration of flows from open field regions, however it requires counter propagating waves packets. While counter propagating waves are prevalent in loops, it is unclear if they are present in open field regions. The high temporal and spatial resolution of Cryo-NIRSP, along withs its excellent signal to noise levels, offers an unprecedented opportunity to discover the nature of high-frequency Alfvénic waves in open field regions."

        "experimentDescription": "Solar active regions (AR) are strongly magnetized extended areas populated with sunspots, plages, jets, filaments/prominences, and magnetic loops. They produce powerful explosions such as flares and CMEs, and contribute to the generation of the solar wind. The structure and dynamics of ARs are a central topic in solar research. Due to the complex multi-thermal, multi-scale and highly dynamical nature of solar active regions, advanced high-resolution, multi-instrumental observations are essential for investigating and understanding their dynamics, structure, and morphology. Through this proposal, we aim to perform spatially and temporally combined observations of solar AR with ESA’s Space-based Solar Orbiter mission and DKIST. In April 2025, SO plans to have coordinated observations dedicated to the Observing Plan (SOOP),  R_SMALL_HRES_HCAD_RS-burst. The DKIST proposal requests on-disk observations in coordination with SO during this period. We will focus on some of the most intriguing topics of active region physics, such as driving mechanisms of frequently observed plasma upflows into the corona at the border of the AR and the coupling between the corona and lower solar atmosphere (photosphere/chromosphere)."

These are crucial to our understanding of the physics of solar flares and are vital diagnostics for the processes of energy transport and dissipation. The main observing goal of the proposal is to measure the spatial separation between flare ribbons in different spectral lines. We plan to perform simultaneous spectroscopy in Na I D1 589 nm, Ca II 854 nm and Hβ 486 nm with ViSP. Of particular interest are the Hβ and Ca II 854.2 nm line wing ribbons, as a previous study indicates a large separation between them. Observations will be combined with the numerical and semi-empirical models. This will help us to investigate the formation heights of flare ribbons and the energy deposition depth in the flare atmosphere. "
